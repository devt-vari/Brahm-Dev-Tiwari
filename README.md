# 🚀 About Me

As an Analyst at Amazon, I help organizations leverage data to solve complex problems and drive business growth. I use Amazon Quicksight, Microsoft Power BI, Pandas, Matplotlib, SQL, Redshift and other tools to transform raw data into actionable insights that inform strategic decision-making. I have successfully delivered multiple projects, such as creating dashboards, reports, and visualizations for various clients and stakeholders.

I am also pursuing my master's degree in computer science, with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, at Woolf. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to real-world scenarios. I have completed several courses and certifications, such as Data at Amazon, Redshift SQL at Amazon, Google Analytics, Problem Solving Techniques, and Communication Foundations, to enhance my skills and knowledge. I am confident in my ability to make a significant impact in any data-driven role. I am excited to leverage my skills and experience to help organizations achieve their goals and maximize their potential.
